Day 27: Testing

Goal for this project is just to create test cases for a solution.
THe problem is the following:

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of  students. Frustrated with
their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than
students are present when class starts. Given the arrival time of each
student, determine if the class is canceled.

Output should be YES or NO

first line t, contains number of lectures,
second line has 2 space separated integers, n (number of students), and
k (cancellation threshold)
third line contains N space separated integers describint the array of students'
arrival times.
