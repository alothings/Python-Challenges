"""
Given a non-empty array of integers, write a function that returns the longest 
strictly-increasing subsequence in the array.

A subsequence is a set of numbers that aren't necesarily adjacent in the array,
but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.

Input:
array = [5, 7, -24, 12, 10, 2, 3, 12, 5, 6, 35]

output:
[-24, 2, 3, 5, 6, 35]
