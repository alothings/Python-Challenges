"""
Given a list of airports (three-letter codes), a list of routes (one-way flights
from one airport to another like ["JFK", "SFO"]), and a starting point.

Write a function that returns the inimum number of airport connections (one-way) 
that need to be added in order for someone to be able to reach any airport in the 
list, starting at the starting airport.

Note: 
- routes only allow you to fly in one direction [origin, destination]
- connections don't have to be direct, it is ok if an airport can only be reached 
  from the starting airport by stopping at other airports first
